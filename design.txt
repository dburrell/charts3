GRAPH OBJECT DESIGN
=========================
graph  
  type
  headers[] (alice, bob)
  series[]  (maths, history)
  values = [,]
  draw()
  
                          SERIES 1	      SERIES 2	      SERIES x  
HEADERS	                  maths	          history	      series[x].name
record 1    alice	      7	              1               values.get(1,x)
record 2    bob	          3 	          3    	          values.get(2,x)
record y    headers[y]    5               5               values.get(y,x)



=========================
ASSUMPTION
=========================
Stacked columns will be listed next to each other, so for example:

  Rent (stacked)
  Target(line)
  Bills(stacked)
  
Would not work, because the stacked Bills column will not start above the end of rent

FAQ
=========================

Q: Why not have it animate on data change? (e.g. animated resizing of bar after value change)
A: I can't think of any realistic use-cases that the source data would change without a page refresh anyway. On the occasions this is required, a fadeout/in doesn't lose too much value.
    - If this does become required, the graph animation already exists, so it would involve setting the 0 state to the previous values and going from there (should be included in calculation of fracVal).
    - Would we then want to animate addition/removal of records/series as well?
